-- Fix SECURITY DEFINER Views Migration
-- This migration specifically addresses the SECURITY DEFINER view warnings

-- =============================================================================
-- Drop all existing views that have SECURITY DEFINER
-- =============================================================================

-- Force drop all problematic views
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.index_usage_stats CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.table_sizes CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.companies_with_latest_scores CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.score_leaderboard CASCADE;

-- =============================================================================
-- Recreate views WITHOUT SECURITY DEFINER
